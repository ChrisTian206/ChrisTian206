## Hey there, I'm Wenhao Tian, but you can call me Chris! üëã

I'm a software developer currently located in Vancouver, Canada. I enjoy building full-stack apps, front-end projects, and exploring new things for my side projects. Currently I'm working on a AI real estate platform that helps users to quickly search and learn properties in their targeted region. 

My keen interests in computer science was sparked in my junior year in college, when I was pursuing a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering. In my mechtronice class, I learned C++ to program my first Arduino project, a reverse parking sensor, and was blown away with the excitement of how much things programming can do. Since then, I took a few more courses to graduate college with a minor in Computer Science. In the following years, I dedicate myself pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science degree from Boston University, where I learned much more exciting things like machine learning, web development, database management, SQL/NoSQL, the list goes on. Now, I'm enjoying my life coding and learning. Cheers!
